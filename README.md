# PyBer_Analysis


Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze the rideshare data between January and May 2019.  Date compiled from suburban, urban, and rural areas will be analyzed to create visualizations of rideshare data for Pyber using plotting through Matplotlib.  The purpose is to provide services and determine where prices could be made more affordable to neighborhoods.

Results
 
The summary of shows that the highest fares with lowest driver counts are in rural areas.  The summary also shows that urban areas have the lowest fares with the highest number of drivers available.  When reviewing the data for average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fares, the disparity between each city type is clear.  Urban cities have a higher demand for drivers than rural areas.  This observation could be attributed to living in more densely populated (urban, suburban,)  areas with more people.  In  urban areas the data shows that the average fare per ride is $24.53 and the average fare per driver is $16.57.  Compare that to the total rides for urban areas (1625) to total drivers (2504).  

When you compare rural total rides to rural total drivers, you see that there were more rides than drivers.  The average fare per ride is $34.62 but the average fare per driver is $55.48.  Naturally, rural areas are less dense in people.  Also rides may be farther due to living in a rural area.  This could increase the fare

What is most interesting about this summary is the disparity between average fare and average fare per driver for rural and suburban areas.  If you compare those variables to the total rides and total drivers, you can assume that the issue is directly related to the number of drivers.  

Suburban areas seem to have a better balance on all variables.  Total drivers and total rides numbers are closer together.  It could seem that the total number of rides need to be closer to the total number of drivers, to even out the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  
 

Summary

1. Based upon the data provided for 2019 a recommendation to keep the total number of drivers to the total number rides close, making sure that there are  not more drivers than rides available for a particular city type.

2. When reviewing the line graph, all city types seem to follow the same ebb and flow regarding increases and decrease in revenue per month.  However, a notable dip is seen for rural areas near the beginning of January to mid-January and mid-April  to early May.  The trend in rural areas is a decrease in revenue.  Suburban and Urban areas trend an increase during this same time.  Evaluating the reason for this observation could find more revenue from rural areas.

3. Revenue seems to peak near the end of February and again in April.  However, in urban cities there are multiple peaks (4) from end of February to April.  Delving deeper into the reasons for this could help to increase rideshares in rural areas.
